XML Ripper is a utility to extract the lines between two tags in an xml. 

Simply specify the path to the folder where the xml files are present. It can navigate through all the files, get their file names and goes through every file to do the extraction. 

The code is not well structured, it may have hard coded declarations, you may clone it and alter as per your discretion. 

Use the "TagRipper.java" file to get the ripping job done. Kindly ignore "MultiTagRipper.java" for the extraction purpose.
